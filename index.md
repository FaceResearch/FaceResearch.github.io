### Impression Formation

#### [Impression formation and trust](https://uwe.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cvRR6hJqLYFnuLA){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

*You have the choice to enter into a raffle for a **£50 Amazon Voucher** for taking part!*

Current research suggests that social judgments can be made from faces within an extremely short time and often without much mental effort. Here, we are interested in how judgments interact with information about people’s behaviour in forming perceptions of trust.

#### [Smiling: a diverse perspective](https://uwe.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_ewGB27WyAfK5jcq){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

Current research suggests that smiling elicits more positive perceptions by others compared to a neutral expression, for attributes such as attractiveness and perceived personality traits like agreeableness. This effect appears particularly pronounced when hetereosexual men judge women’s face images, which has been interpreted as evidence that women may more effectively employ (and benefit from) smiling in inter-sexual relationships. Here, we are interested in whether these effects can be replicated with a more diverse stimulus set, and exploring the effect of individual differences in perceived sexual interest.
