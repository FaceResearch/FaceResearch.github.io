### Impression Formation

#### [Impression formation and trust](https://uwe.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cvRR6hJqLYFnuLA){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

*You have the choice to enter into a raffle for a **£50 Amazon Voucher** for taking part!*

Current research suggests that social judgments can be made from faces within an extremely short time and often without much mental effort. Here, we are interested in how judgments interact with information about people’s behaviour in forming perceptions of trust.

- **Type**: Implicit Association Task, Rating
- **Length**: ~30 mins

#### [Impression formation and makeup](https://uwe.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2l6IS20XCRPYSQ6){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

This online study is looking for participants that identify as **women** and are **aged 18 to 45**. It is investigating the relationship between self-perceptions, cosmetic wearing and competitiveness. In today’s (social) media-saturated society, young women especially are thought to experience both pressure to conform to societal appearance-based ideals as well as competition with each other. Here, we want to investigate the ways in which women manipulate cosmetic appearance in a range of different scenarios.

#### [Smiling: a diverse perspective](https://uwe.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_ewGB27WyAfK5jcq){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

Current research suggests that smiling elicits more positive perceptions by others compared to a neutral expression, for attributes such as attractiveness and perceived personality traits like agreeableness. This effect appears particularly pronounced when hetereosexual men judge women’s face images, which has been interpreted as evidence that women may more effectively employ (and benefit from) smiling in inter-sexual relationships. Here, we are interested in whether these effects can be replicated with a more diverse stimulus set, and exploring the effect of individual differences in perceived sexual interest.

### Emotion Perception

#### [Emotion perception and gender-typicality](https://uwe.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_39Nq4ggPY5cKQ0m){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

Current research suggests that men and women differ in the accuracy with which they perceive facial emotions: on average, women tend to do better in recognising subtle facial expressions compared to men. Here, we are interested in exploring this sex difference as well as whether gender-typicality has an effect on facial emotion recognition capabilities (e.g., do more feminine men perform better in facial emotion recognition compared to more masculine men?).
