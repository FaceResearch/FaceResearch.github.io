## Participate in online experiments!

We are currently looking for participants for several undergrad dissertation projects:

### [Impression formation and trust](https://uwe.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cvRR6hJqLYFnuLA)

Current research suggests that social judgments can be made from faces within an extremely short time (100 ms), and that humans can infer these characteristics without much mental effort. Here, we are interested in how judgments we make from faces interact with information about people’s behaviour in forming perceptions of trust.

### [The effect of smiling on social judgements](https://uwe.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_ewGB27WyAfK5jcq )

Current research suggests that smiling elicits more positive perceptions by others compared to a neutral expression, for attributes such as attractiveness and perceived personality traits like agreeableness. This effect is particularly pronounced when men judge women’s face images, which is interpreted as evidence women may more effectively employ and benefit from smiling in inter-sexual relationships. We are interested in whether these effects can be replicated, and if so, exploring the relationship between the results and a romantic contribution.
